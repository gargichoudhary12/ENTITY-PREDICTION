# Entity-Pediction

- **DESCRIPTION -** The main purpose behind this project is to create a model that would effectively categorize entities within a given texts into specific predefined categories. This process makes it valuable for various applications like information extraction, sentiment analysis and text understanding.


  

- **PREREQUISITES-**
  1) Python
  2) Google Colab
 

     

- **LIBRARIES USED -**
  1) NumPy - used during data preprocessing, feature engineering and handling numerical aspects of the data.
  2) Scikit-learn - it provides a wide range of tools and functionalities to handle various machine learning tasks, like data preprocessing, feature engineering, modelling and prediction, evaluation and metrices.
  3) Pytorch - an open-source deep learning framework that helps in named entity recognition (NER), data loading, model architecture, training and optimization, model evaluation.
 
These python based libraries are used for processing and feature extraction.




- **MODEL DESIGN -** The steps involved in the designing of this model are:
  1) Data Collection and Annotation
  2) Preprocessing
  3) Feature Extraction
  4) Model Selection
  5) Model Training
  6) Evaluation
  7) Fine Tuning
  8) Iteration
 
  The Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning models like RNN are built for entity classification.
  The model is trained on labelled data where each entity in the text is annotated with its corresponding type.




- **DOMAIN -** Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing


 


- **PROJECT TYPE -** Individual
